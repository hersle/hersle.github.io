I'm Herman, a PhD student in astrophysics at the University of Oslo.
My research interests are theoretical and computational physics, cosmology and large-scale structure formation.
Besides, I like running, bike touring and fiddling with computers and programming.

When?        What?                                                                                                                                                    Where?
