## Gravitational waves

[Popular explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHS9g72npqA) from moving point masses and finite speed of propagation, by analogy to electromagnetic waves, water waves and sound waves.

## Spontaneous symmetry breaking

![A potential with zero expectation value can change shape and develop a nonzero expectation value as the universe cools down, for example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking_%28explanatory_diagram%29.png)

### Noether's theorem

A global continuous symmetry leads to a conserved current, which in turn yields to constant charges.

### Goldstone's theorem

The spontaneous breaking of a global continuous symmetry yields massless bosons.
If the symmetry is only *approximate*, the bosons are *light*.

### Higgs mechanism

The spontaneous breaking of a *gauge* symmetry massive gauge bosons with an additional degree of freedom (instead of massless Goldstone bosons).
The mass is generated by the nonzero vacuum expectation vlaue of the field in its broken phase.

#### Example

The potential of
$$ \mathcal{L} = -\frac14 F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + (D_\mu \phi)^\dagger (D^\mu \phi) + \mu^2 (\phi^\dagger \phi) - \lambda (\phi^\dagger \phi)^2 $$
with electromagnetic stress-energy tensor $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$
and covariant derivative $D_\mu = \partial_\mu + i e A_\mu$
gets a nonzero vacuum expectation value when $\mu^2 > 0$.

In polar coordinates $\phi = \rho(x) e^{i \theta(x)}$:
$$ \mathcal{L} = -\frac14 F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + (\partial_\mu \rho)^2 + \rho^2 (\partial_\mu \theta + e A_\mu)^2 + \mu^2 \rho^2 - \lambda \rho^4 $$


* **[Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem):**
global continuous symmetry → conserved currents → constant charges

* **[Goldstone's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_boson):**
spontaneously broken global continuous symmetry → massless bosons
(if the symmetry is *approximate*, the bosons are *light*)

* **[Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism)**:
spontaneously broken *gauge* symmetry → massive gauge boson with additional transverse degree of freedom

Spontaneous symmetry breaking,
a field develops nonzero vacuum expectation value,
other fields aquire masses proportional to the nonzero vacuum expectation value.
occurs whenever a *charged* field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value
