Packing list
============

Bike
----

- [ ] **Bike** (hybrid or touring bike for "normal" touring; road bikes for speed and light packing on paved roads; mountain bike for unpaved roads; gravel for something in-between)
- [ ] **Helmet** (otherwise you are a *fucking asshole*; invest in a [MIPS helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-directional_Impact_Protection_System) if you value your head)
- [ ] **Pump** ([Topeak Road Morph G](https://www.topeak.com/global/en/product/246-ROAD-MORPH-G) is compact with a gauge and small foot stand; never bring a [screw-on pump](https://ride.lezyne.com/products/pocket-drive) without a valve core tool!)
- [ ] **Lock** (you probably spend most of the time in remote areas and on or very close to your bike, so a combination cable lock to deny opportunistic theft is sufficient)
- [ ] **Front and back lights** (essential for safety in the dark and in tunnels)
- [ ] **Bottle cages** (the more, the better; most bikes have space for two in the frame triangle, and some have an additional one below the frame)
- [ ] **Fenders** (makes riding in the rain comfortable; reduces frequency of maintenance)
- [ ] **Phone mount?**

Tools and spare parts
---------------------

*MacGyver*

- [ ] **Bike multi-tool** (at least with hex keys and screwdriver; preferably also chain breaker, valve core tool spoke, like [Lezyne RAP II 18](https://ride.lezyne.com/collections/multi-tools-category/products/rap-ii-tool?variant=34854348095650))
- [ ] **General multi-tool** (pliers, knives, scissors etc. can come in handy)
- [ ] **Spare tube** (2+ if remote), **patch kit** and **tire levers**
- [ ] **Oil** (except for one night stands?)
- [ ] **Repair tape** (for fixing ripped tires, holes in sleeping pad and tent, ...)
- [ ] **Chain link** (?)

Storage
-------

*Combine what you need*

- [ ] **Back rack and panniers** (boring and balanced classical set-up; [Ortlieb Classic Back Rollers](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/back-roller-classic) are beloved; axle-mounted rack like [Bontrager Lightweight MIK BackRack](https://www.trekbikes.com/international/en_IN_TL/equipment/bike-accessories/bike-racks/bontrager-backrack-lightweight-mik-rear-rack/p/27224/) is sturdiest for bikes without eyelets)
- [ ] **Front rack and panniers** (extension classical set-up for longer tours; increases bike stability; [Ortlieb Sport Rollers Classic](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/sport-roller-classic) are beloved)
- [ ] **Bungee straps** (for securing items (bulky items like tents, or on-demand after shopping) on top of the back rack; doubles as laundry line while biking)
- [ ] **Frame bag** (good for road/gravel bikes and light touring; full bags like [Revelate Designs Ripio](https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/Frame-Bags/Ripio) blocks bottle cages)
- [ ] **Handlebar bag** (for easy access to frequent phone, wallet, charger, ID)
- [ ] **Saddle bag** (small ones could store puncture repair items; larger rocket-like ones can be used in a bike-packing setup)
- [ ] **Dry bags** (those with lash points, like [Sea To Summit Big River](https://seatosummit.com/products/the-big-river-dry-bag), are best to strap)

Navigation
----------
- [ ] **Phone**

Sleep
-----

- [ ] **Tent** (the comfort of a 2-person tent is worth the weight, and makes it easy to unpack your panniers)
- [ ] **Hammock and tarp** (less flexible, but an option if you are *absolutely sure* there are trees)
- [ ] **Sleeping pad** ([inflatable](https://www.exped.com/en/products/sleeping-mats/dura-5r) more comfort and packability, or [closed-cell foam (CCF)](https://www.thermarest.com/ie/sleeping-pads/fast-and-light/z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad/z-lite-sol.html) for more durability)
- [ ] **Sleeping bag** (in a compression bag to save space; down is lighter and more compact than synthetic ones, but must be kept dry!)
- [ ] **Pillow** ([inflatable]() or a buff covering a bag of clothes, or something similar)

Electronics
-----------

- [ ] **Phone** ([OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) is a *must* for offline maps, routing and locating toilets, water fountains, shelters, preferably using [BRouter](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/routing/brouter/) for optimal routing; [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) for commerical information, accurate opening hours and public transport information; ...)
- [ ] **Power bank** (20 000 mAh lasts a few days; compatible with quick charging to make the most of breaks)
- [ ] **Charger and cables** (for all your devices; compatible with quick charging to make the most of breaks)

Health
------

- [ ] **First aid kit** (maybe you can hang it on the driver's side of your bike)
- [ ] **Tooth brush and paste**
- [ ] **Soap, shampoo and deodorant** (bring small handluggage-friendly bottles to save space; get something that works for the whole body?)
- [ ] **Toilet paper** (for cleaning your ass, but also your kitchen equipment when you don't have access to water)
- [ ] **Hand sanitizer** (for cleaning your hands)
- [ ] **Baby wipes** (for some "quick" hygiene)
- [ ] **Towel** (for drying your body, a wet tent floor, your bike seat, etc; consider a fast-drying hiking towel to save space)
- [ ] **Insect repellant** (it absolutely sucks taking brakes or climbing when flies and mosquitoes are rampant and you cannot outrun them)
- [ ] **Sunscreen** (you may be exposed to the sun for long days)
- [ ] **Ear plugs and face mask** (to get good sleep!)

Clothes
-------

*Technical clothing that you normally use on short trips may smell sour, get you cold and not be the best on longer trips!*

- [ ] **Bike gloves** (half ones helps reduce sweat on handlebars; full ones also keeps your fingers warmer in cold, windy and wet conditions; padded ones particularly reduces pressure on to avoid ulnar nerve issues)
- [ ] **Shorts** (also for bathing? unless you are very comfortable on your saddle, consider padded ones for comfort on multi-day trips)
- [ ] **Shirts** ("netting" transports moisture)
- [ ] **Shoes** (I find (trail) running shoes (e.g. from Salomon) to be a good balance between "casual" and "sporty", and they have a hard sole)
- [ ] **Sandals** (nice for a change in breaks, around camp and to air your feet )
- [ ] **Rain/wind jacket/pants** (don't overdo it; you get wet from rain or sweat)
- [ ] **Rain shoe cover**
- [ ] **Buff** (multi-purpose)
- [ ] **Glasses** (otherwise, expect insects and particles to get in your eye; this can cause uncomfortable and even dangerous situations if it happens at the worst possible time)
- [ ] **Laundry bag** (use a net to do your laundry in fresh water or laundromats, or even a bag that can be filled with water)
- [ ] **Visibility vest** (very worthwhile in tunnels)

Food
----

- [ ] **Food** (and a food bag; buy along the way; use empty packaging as trash bags)
- [ ] **Drinks** (one solid water, but also one free slot to make room for "varying" drinks like orange juice)
- [ ] **Cutlery** ([good knife that can also cut bread](https://www.victorinox.com/us/en/Products/Cutlery/Paring-Knives/Swiss-Classic-Tomato-and-Table-Knife/p/6.7833), fork and a spoon)
- [ ] **Plate/bowl/board** (may be combined?)
- [ ] **Coffee cup** (a small foldable one)
- [ ] **Camping stove and fuel (gas)** (much cheaper and cozier than buying dinners)

Documents
---------

- [ ] **Identification**
- [ ] **Debit / credit card / cash**
- [ ] **Medical card**
- [ ] **Paper map**

Personal items
--------------

- [ ] **Personal items** (don't forget!)
