Packing list
============

Here is a list of what I consider bare minimum items for multi-day bike touring:

Bike
----

- [ ] **Bike** (hybrid or touring bike for "normal" touring; road bikes for speed and light packing on paved roads; mountain bike for unpaved roads; gravel for something in-between)
- [ ] **Helmet** (otherwise you are a *fucking asshole*; invest in a [MIPS helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-directional_Impact_Protection_System) if you value your head)
- [ ] **Pump** ([Topeak Road Morph G](https://www.topeak.com/global/en/product/246-ROAD-MORPH-G) is compact with a gauge and small foot stand; never bring a [screw-on pump](https://ride.lezyne.com/products/pocket-drive) without a valve core tool!)
- [ ] **Lock** (you probably spend most of the time in remote areas and on or very close to your bike, so a combination cable lock to deny opportunistic theft is sufficient)
- [ ] **Front and back lights** (essential for safety in the dark and in tunnels)
- [ ] **Bottle cages** (the more, the better)
- [ ] **Fenders** (makes riding in the rain comfortable; reduces frequency of maintenance)
- [ ] **Phone mount?**

Tools
-----

*MacGyver*

- [ ] **Bike multi-tool** (at least with hex keys and screwdriver; preferably also chain breaker, valve core tool spoke, like [Lezyne RAP II 18](https://ride.lezyne.com/collections/multi-tools-category/products/rap-ii-tool?variant=34854348095650))
- [ ] **General multi-tool** (pliers, knives, scissors etc. can come in handy)
- [ ] **Spare tube** (2+ if remote), **patch kit** and **tire levers**
- [ ] **Oil** (except for one night stands?)
- [ ] **Repair tape** (for fixing ripped tires, holes in sleeping pad and tent, ...)

Storage
-------

*Combine what you need*

- [ ] **Back rack and panniers** (boring and balanced classical set-up; [Ortlieb Classic Back Rollers](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/back-roller-classic) are beloved; axle-mounted rack like [Bontrager Lightweight MIK BackRack](https://www.trekbikes.com/international/en_IN_TL/equipment/bike-accessories/bike-racks/bontrager-backrack-lightweight-mik-rear-rack/p/27224/) is sturdiest for bikes without eyelets)
- [ ] **Front rack and panniers** (extension classical set-up for longer tours; increases bike stability; [Ortlieb Sport Rollers Classic](https://www.ortlieb.com/en_us/sport-roller-classic) are beloved)
- [ ] **Bungee straps** (for securing items (bulky items like tents, or on-demand after shopping) on top of the back rack; doubles as laundry line while biking)
- [ ] **Frame bag** (good for road/gravel bikes and light touring; full bags like [Revelate Designs Ripio](https://www.revelatedesigns.com/index.cfm/store.catalog/Frame-Bags/Ripio) blocks bottle cages)
- [ ] **Handlebar bag** (for easy access to frequent phone, wallet, charger, ID)
- [ ] **Saddle bag** (small ones could store puncture repair items; larger rocket-like ones can be used in a bike-packing setup)
- [ ] **Dry bags** (those with lash points, like [Sea To Summit Big River](https://seatosummit.com/products/the-big-river-dry-bag), are best to strap)

Navigation
----------
- [ ] **Phone**

Sleep
-----

- [ ] **Tent** (the comfort of a 2-person tent is worth the weight, and makes it easy to unpack your panniers)
- [ ] **Hammock and tarp** (less flexible, but an option if you are *absolutely sure* there are trees)
- [ ] **Sleeping pad** (CCF or inflatable?)
- [ ] **Sleeping bag** (down is lighter and more compact than synthetic ones, but must be kept dry!)
- [ ] **Pillow**

Electronics
-----------

- [ ] **Phone** ([OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) is a *must* for offline maps, routing and locating toilets, water fountains, shelters, preferably using [BRouter](https://osmand.net/docs/user/navigation/routing/brouter/) for optimal routing; [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) for commerical information, accurate opening hours and public transport information; ...)
- [ ] **Power bank** (20 000 mAh lasts a few days; compatible with quick charging to make the most of breaks)
- [ ] **Charger and cables** (compatible with quick charging to make the most of breaks)

Health
------

- [ ] First aid kit
- [ ] Tooth brush and paste
- [ ] Soap, shampoo and deodorant
- [ ] Hand sanitizer
- [ ] Towel
- [ ] Toilet paper
- [ ] Insect repellant
- [ ] Sunscreen

Clothes
-------

- [ ] Bike gloves (half and full)
- [ ] Shorts (padded for multi-day trips) (for bathing)
- [ ] Shirts
- [ ] Shoes
- [ ] Sandals?
- [ ] Rain/wind jacket (pants?) (don't overdo it; you get wet from rain or sweat)
- [ ] **Visibility vest** (unless very worthtunnels)
- [ ] Glasses
- [ ] Rain shoe cover
- [ ] Laundry bag
- [ ] Straps (to hang laundry on bike)

Food
----

- [ ] Food
- [ ] Water
- [ ] Cutlery, at least a good knife?
- [ ] Camping stove and fuel (gas)?

Documents
---------

- [ ] Identification
- [ ] Debit / credit card / cash
- [ ] Medical card?
- [ ] Paper map?
